### A Machine Learning Framework for Early Asthma Diagnosis 

**Project motivation:** Asthma is a chronic lung condition that impacts roughly 300 million people worldwide across all ages, genders, and ethnic groups. Disadvantaged communities tend to have higher rates of the disease, highlighting the structural inequality to healthcare access. Implementing proactive strategies to address this issue will enhance health coverage while also easing the economic burden of disease on the U.S. government. This projectâ€™s goal is to create predictive models for early-onset asthma using social and socioeconomic factors in hopes to improve patient quality of life and reduce healthcare costs. I implemented four machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression for simple comprehension of potentially linear patterns, CART for capturing non-linear patterns, XGBoost for handling any missing data, and Random Forests for handling complex patterns. The dataset used in the models includes anonymized patient demographics, medical history, and environmental factors. 

**Feature Selection:** To select features for model creation I used Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Features with a VIF below 5 were retained, resulting in 20 features.

**Model Selection:**
## 1. Logistic Regression
## 2. Random Forest Classifier
## 3. Decision Tree (CART)
## 4. XGBoost

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
